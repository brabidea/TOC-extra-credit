What was the extra work
I made a threestack tm and a ntm
Why did you choose it (i.e. in what area did you feel deficient and how did this work help improve your understanding) You can point to specific homeworks or problem types on exams.
i felt that i needed to review these topics more and the helped me prepare for the exam when i was making them. They also were part of the other options for project 2 part 3.
What files are what
the ntm is the non-deterministic turing machine and threestacktm is the three stack turing machine
